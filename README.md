Technologies used:
-Bootstrap for carousel 
-Stackoverflow for help with the navbar (highlighting based on area of page)

Process/Approach:
1)Write the code out without thinking about efficiency
2)Go back and try to make the code as efficient as possible 
3)Try to make it look as neat as I can 

Unsolved Problems:
 -Deployed Heroku website has missing images, incorrect style, no animation 
 -Could not figure out how to make modal (lightbox) code as DRY as possible
 

Biggest Wins:
    1)Getting the modals (lightbox) to work 
    2)Animating the text and images

Biggest Challenges: 
    1)Making the modal code shorter/using jquery with it
